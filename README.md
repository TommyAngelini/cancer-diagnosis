### Diagnosing Renal Cancer Using CNNs
___
The Convolutional Neural Network developed in this model is fed 2,228 images provided by the USC Keck School of Medicine of tumors in the kidney being checked for clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC). The CNN works to classify the tumor in each image as either benign or malignant.

### Motivation
___
This project was created with the purpose of helping USC's radiologists to find what visual features within a renal tumor are most indicative of a benign or malignant tumor. By developing this deep learning network, we hope to track these features and implement accessible ways to apply automated diagnosis to assist radiologists.

### Tech / Framework Used
___
This project was built using Atom.

### How to Use
___
In order to run the current project, simply run conv_net.py in your terminal:
'''python conv_net.py'''
